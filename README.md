# NextJS Course by John Smilga

- Most popular React Framework for building full stack react applications
- We have server components and server actions in Next.js
- To create nextJS app we have this command:
```shell
npx create-next-app@latest appName
```
# Homepage
- page.tsx in the root of app folder
- represents root of our application '/' local domain or production domain
- react component (server component)

# Create Pages in Next.js
- in the app folder create a folder with the page.js file
  1. about/page.js
  2. contact/page.js
- can have .js .jsx .tsx extension
- Now we can directly navigate to localhost:3000/about or localhost:3000/contact
- No need to set up React Router

# Link Component
- navigate around the project
- import Link from 'next/link' home page

```js
import Link from 'next/link';
const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className='text-7xl'>HomePage</h1>
      <Link href='/about' className='text-xl text-blue-500 inline-block mt-8'>
        about page
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
};
export default HomePage;
```

# Nested Routes
- app/info/contact/page.tsx
- if no page.tsx in a segment will result in 404
- go to app folder, create info folder, create contact folder and then create page.tsx

# CSS and Tailwind
- If we want to use vanilla css, then we can use it in globals.css
- For rest of it use Tailwind

# Tailwind CSS
- Apply utility classes directly in html
- mx-auto places element in the center
- bg-green-500(for background color)
- px-6, py-6,mt-4,p-4(1rem)
- p-1-->padding:0.25rem
- pr-4 (padding-right:1rem)
- px-4(padding to top and bottom of 1rem)
- w-4(width:1rem)
- 1 rem = 16px
- w-1/2(width:50%)
- w-full(width:100%)
- hover:bg-sky-500
- w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48 (medium screen(768px) width of 32 and large screen(1024px) width of 48rem)
- w-[100px] means a width of 100px [] brackets can help to define custom width.
# Layouts and Templates
## layout.tsx
- This page wraps other pages and layouts and helps us to share a layout
- This is similar to master-pages we have in ASP.NET MVC Applications
- This is a kind of component which is used in all the page
- pages changes but layout doesnt
- It wraps our entire application
- Layout is a component which wraps other pages and layouts. 
- Allow to share UI. 
- Even when the route changes, layout DOES NOT re-render.
- Can fetch data but can't pass it down to children.
- layout.tsx also has the children prop
- Inside the children prop we will have all of our pages
- the top-most layout is called the Root Layout. 
- This required layout is shared across all pages in an application. 
- Root layouts must contain html and body tags.
- any route segment can optionally define its own Layout. These layouts will be shared across all pages in that segment.
- layouts in a route are nested by default. Each parent layout wraps child layouts below it using the React children prop.
```js
import './globals.css'

export default function RootLayout({children}: {children: React.ReactNode}) {
  return (
      <html lang="en">
      <body>
      <nav>hello there</nav>
      {children}
      </body>
      </html>
  )
}
```
## template.tsx
- Difference between layout.tsx and template.tsx is that layout.tsx never re-renders but template.tsx re-renders

# Fonts - Google Fonts
- Automatically self-host any Google Font. Fonts are included in the deployment and served from the same domain as your deployment. No requests are sent to Google by the browser.
- Below we can change the fonts easily by just importing them and providing them with their properties and use them
```js
import './globals.css';
import { Inter,Inconsolata,Roboto } from 'next/font/google';


const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
const inconsolata  = Inconsolata({subsets:['latin']});
const roboto = Roboto({subsets:['latin'],weight:['400']})

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <nav>hello there</nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```

# Metadata
- Next.js has a Metadata API that can be used to define your application metadata (e.g. meta and link tags inside your HTML head element) for improved SEO and web shareability.
- To define static metadata, export a Metadata object from a layout.tsx or page.tsx file.

```js
import type { Metadata } from 'next';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js Project',
  description: 'A Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS.',
  keywords: 'Next.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS',
};
```

# Server Components VS Client Components
- BY DEFAULT, NEXT.JS USES SERVER COMPONENTS !!!!
- To use Client Components, you can add the React "use client" directive

## Benefits of server components :
- data fetching: Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source. This can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the amount of requests the client needs to make.
- security: Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.
- caching: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users. This can improve performance and reduce cost by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.
- bundle size: Server Components allow you to keep large dependencies that previously would impact the client JavaScript bundle size on the server. This is beneficial for users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the client does not have to download, parse and execute any JavaScript for Server Components.

## Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint (FCP):
- On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page. 
## Search Engine Optimization and Social Network Shareability
- The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.
## Streaming
- Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.

# Benefits Client Components
- They can hold state
- Interactivity: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.
- Browser APIs: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like geolocation or localStorage, allowing you to build UI for specific use cases.

### We may come across a scenario where we need both client and server components
- Consider a scenario where we have a page that display details about a product, and we have 'Add to Cart' Button and Quantity button
- Product Details are static in nature and can be fetched via Server component
- Add to Cart requires us to hold state about the number of items in state and also interactivity with the users
- So we need to use Client components and server components
- Solution is to create a server component and then load the static data about the product and then add the AddToCart component inside it.


# Data Fetching in Server components
- How did we use to do fetching of data in React?
- Create state, create useEffect and call the fetch API from useEffect and populate the state
- just add async and start using await ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
- the same for db
- Next.js extends the native Web fetch() API to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent caching semantics.
- Fetch is faster on server and since we return HTML it is better with SEO
```ts
import axios from "axios";

const url = 'https://www.course-api.com/react-tours-project';
type Tour = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    info:string;
    image: string;
    price: string;
}

async function ToursPage() {
    const response = await axios(url);
    const data: Tour[] = await response.data;
    console.log(data);
    return (
        <section>
            <h1 className='text-3xl mb-4'>Tours</h1>

            {data.map((tour) => {
                return <h2 key={tour.id}>{tour.name}</h2>;
            })}
        </section>
    )
}

export default ToursPage

```
**Next.js is pretty big on caching stuff**

# Loading Component
- The special file loading.js helps you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense.
- With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads.
- The new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.
- Create a file tours/loading.tsx
- It will work automatically and while we are fetching tours above, it will show loading.tsx
- Internally makes use of React Suspense feature.

```ts
'use client';
const loading = () => {
  return <span className='text-xl capitalize'>loading tours...</span>;
};
export default loading;
```

# Error Component
- The error.tsx file convention allows you to gracefully handle unexpected runtime errors in nested routes.

```ts
'use client';
const error = ({error}:{error:Error}) => {
  return <div>there was an error...</div>;
};
export default error;
```

# Nested Layouts
- create app/tours/layout.tsx
- UI will be applied to app/tours - segment
- don't forget about the "children"
- we can fetch data in the layout but... at the moment can't pass data down to children (pages) 

```ts
function ToursLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <header className='py-2 w-1/2 bg-slate-500 rounded mb-4'>
        <h1 className='text-3xl text-white text-center'>Nested Layout</h1>
      </header>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
export default ToursLayout;
```
- Once we add above code in tours folder, then list of tours will display within this layout as children prop

# Dynamic Routes
- app/tours/[id]/page.tsx
```ts
const page = ({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) => {
  console.log(params);

  return (
          <div>
                  <h1 className='text-4xl'>ID : {params.id}</h1>
  </div>
);
};
export default page;

//Usage
import Link from "next/link";
function HomePage() {
  return (
          <div>
                  <h1 className='text-7xl'>Home Page</h1>
  <Link href='/about' className='text-xl text-blue-500 inline-block mt-8'>
          about page
  </Link>
  </div>
)
}

export default HomePage

```

# Next.js Image Component
- The Next.js Image component extends the HTML  element with features for automatic image optimization
- Size Optimization: Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.
- Visual Stability: Prevent layout shift automatically when images are loading.
- Faster Page Loads: Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.
- Asset Flexibility: On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers
- disable cache
- width and height
- priority property to prioritize the image for loading When true, the image will be considered high priority and preload.
- **prority property ensure the image is pre-loaded**
**We can do custom import in next.js using this code:**
```ts
import mapsImg from '@/images/maps.jpg'
```
# Remote Images
- To use a remote image, the src property should be a URL string.
- Since Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the width, height and optional blurDataURL props manually.
- The width and height attributes are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. The width and height do not determine the rendered size of the image file.

```ts
import Image from "next/image";
import mapsImg from '@/images/maps.jpg'
const url = 'https://www.course-api.com/images/tours/tour-1.jpeg';

const page = async ({ params }:{params:string}) => {
    const {id} = await params;

    return (
        <div>
            <h1 className='text-4xl'>ID : {id}</h1>
            <section className='flex gap-x-4 mt-4'>
                {/* local image */}
                <div>
                    <Image
                        src={mapsImg}
                        alt='maps'
                        width={192}
                        height={192}
                        className='w-48 h-48 object-cover rounded'
                    />
                    <h2>local image</h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <Image
                        src={url}
                        alt='tour'
                        width={192}
                        height={192}
                        priority
                        className='w-48 h-48 object-cover rounded'
                    />
                    <h2>remote image</h2>
                </div>
            </section>
        </div>
    );
};
export default page;

```

- However, remote images will not work by default. We need to add some configuration in next.config
```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'www.course-api.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/images/**',
      },
    ],
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```
- Everytime we add remote images, we need to add it to a list of supported URL Patterns
- To safely allow optimizing images, define a list of supported URL patterns in next.config.mjs. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage.
- restart dev server

# Responsive Images
- The fill prop allows your image to be sized by its parent element
- sizes property helps the browser select the most appropriate image size to load based on the user's device and screen size, improving website performance and user experience.
- Sizes property can also be a string that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. 
- The value of sizes will greatly affect performance for images using fill or which are styled to have a responsive size.

```html
 <Image src={tour.image} alt={tour.name}  fill  sizes='(max-width:768px) 100vw' priority className='object-cover rounded' />
```

## The sizes property serves two important purposes related to image performance:
- First, the value of sizes is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from next/image's automatically-generated source set. 
- When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. 
- The sizes property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen.
- If you don't specify a sizes value in an image with the fill property, a default value of 100vw (full screen width) is used.

- Second, the sizes property configures how next/image automatically generates an image source set. 
- If no sizes value is present, a small source set is generated, suitable for a fixed-size image.
- If sizes is defined, a large source set is generated, suitable for a responsive image.
- If the sizes property includes sizes such as 50vw, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the source set is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.
```ts
return (
  <div className='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8'>
    {data.map((tour) => {
      return (
        <Link
          key={tour.id}
          href={`/tours/${tour.id}`}
          className='hover:text-blue-500'
        >
          <div className='relative h-48 mb-2'>
            <Image
              src={tour.image}
              alt={tour.name}
              fill
              sizes='33vw'
              // sizes='(max-width:768px) 100vw,(max-width:1200px) 50vw, 33vw'
              priority
              className='object-cover rounded'
            />
          </div>
          <h2>{tour.name}</h2>
        </Link>
      );
    })}
  </div>
);
```

# Routing (continued)
- We know that any folder we create under app folder becomes our URL segment
- What if we want to have folder to have some logic and not be a route
- Simply need to go with \_folder_name
- We can also group the routes
- Say we want to have a folder dashboard and then inside that we want to have separate folders for dashboard and profile
- We cannot keep on doing \dashboard\dashboard\
- So we can simply do this: name the folder with parentheses: (folder)
- Also, if we want to catch the params we can use [folder_name]
- create app/(dashboard)/auth/[sign-in]
- Now when we navigate to locahost:3000/auth/sign-in, the text: 'sign-in' would be our params
- Lets say we want to capture an array of params like this: localhost:3000/auth/sign-in/123/hello
- Then we create a folder like this [...sign-in]
- When we capture the params we get this: { 'sign-in': [ 'sign-in', '123', 'hello' ] }
```ts
const SignInPage = async ({ params }: { params: { 'sign-in': string } }) => {
    debugger;
    const test = await params;
    console.log(test)

    return <div>SignIn1Page</div>;
};
export default SignInPage;
```
- We can do something like params['sign-in'][1] to get the value of 123
- These are all known as **Dynamic Routes**
   1. [...folder] - Catch-all route segment
   2. [[...folder]] Optional catch-all route segment (used by Clerk)

# Server Actions
- Modify stuff on the server directly from our component
- We can directly do some server logic inside our code and place it inside our code
- asynchronous server functions that can be called directly from your components.
- What is the typical setup for server state mutations (create, update, delete)?
1. We have endpoint on the server (api route on Next.js)
2. We make request from the front-end (setup form, handle submission etc)
- Next.js server actions allow you to mutate server state directly from within a React component by defining server-side logic alongside client-side interactions.

## However these server actions follow some rules
1. They must be async
2. We need to add 'user server' in function body(only in React Server Component)
3. We can use in React Client Component but only as an import

```ts
export default function ServerComponent() {
  async function myAction(formData) {
    'use server';
    // access input values with formData
    // formData.get('name')
    // mutate data (server)
    // revalidate cache
  }

  return <form action={myAction}>...</form>;
}
```
- We can set them up separately also in separate files like this:
```ts
'use server';

export async function myAction() {
  // ...
}
```
- then we can import them like this:
```ts
'use client';

import { myAction } from './actions';

export default function ClientComponent() {
  return (
    <form action={myAction}>
      <button type='submit'>Add to Cart</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
# Actions Page - Setup
- Example of a component with server action is as follows:

```ts
const createUser = async()=>{
    'use server'
    console.log('creating user...')

}

function Form() {
    return (
        <form action={createUser} className={formStyle}>
            <h2 className='text-2xl capitalize mb-4'>create User</h2>
            <input className={inputStyle} name='firstName' type="text" defaultValue='peter' required />
            <input className={inputStyle} name='lastName' type="text" defaultValue='willy' required />
            <button className={btnStyle} name='submit' type='submit'>Submit</button>
        </form>
    )
}

const formStyle = 'max-w-lg flex flex-col gap-y-4  shadow rounded p-8';
const inputStyle = 'border shadow rounded py-2 px-3 text-gray-700';
const btnStyle =
    'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded capitalize';


export default Form

```
- In the above createUser is a server action method, but this is not a best practice
- We want to create a separate folder called actions and annotate it with 'use server'
- Then we can import it inside the client Component Form like this

```ts
'use client'

import {createUserAction as createUser} from "@/app/utils/actions";

function Form() {
  return (
          <form action={createUser} className={formStyle}>
  <h2 className='text-2xl capitalize mb-4'>create User</h2>
  <input className={inputStyle} name='firstName' type="text" defaultValue='peter' required />
  <input className={inputStyle} name='lastName' type="text" defaultValue='willy' required />
  <button className={btnStyle} name='submit' type='submit'>Submit</button>
          </form>
)
}

const formStyle = 'max-w-lg flex flex-col gap-y-4  shadow rounded p-8';
const inputStyle = 'border shadow rounded py-2 px-3 text-gray-700';
const btnStyle =
        'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded capitalize';


export default Form


//Create a folder called actions and export all actions within it
'use server'
export const createUserAction = async(formData:FormData)=>{
  'use server'
  const firstName = formData.get('firstName') as string;
  const lastName = formData.get('lastName') as string;
  const rawData = Object.fromEntries(formData);
  console.log(rawData)
};
```

# Backend logic inside Server Actions
- We can save data, fetch data inside server actions as follows:
```ts
'use server'
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
type User = {
    id: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
};
export const createUserAction = async(formData:FormData)=>{
    'use server'
    const firstName = formData.get('firstName') as string;
    const lastName = formData.get('lastName') as string;
    const newUser: User = { firstName, lastName, id: Date.now().toString() };
    await saveUser(newUser);
};

export const fetchUsers = async (): Promise<User[]> => {
    const result = await readFile('users.json', { encoding: 'utf8' });
    const users = result ? JSON.parse(result) : [];
    return users;
};
const saveUser = async (user: User) => {
    const users = await fetchUsers();
    users.push(user);
    await writeFile('users.json', JSON.stringify(users));
};

```

# Revalidate Cache and Redirect
- Next.js aggressively caches all of our resources,so in the above code, even if we have saved data, nothing is reflected on the screen.
- So to show data immediately, we have 2 options:
1. Re-validate path:

```ts
import {revalidatePath} from "next/cache";
import {redirect} from "next/navigation";

export const createUserAction = async (formData: FormData) => {
  'use server'
  const firstName = formData.get('firstName') as string;
  const lastName = formData.get('lastName') as string;
  const newUser: User = {firstName, lastName, id: Date.now().toString()};
  await saveUser(newUser);
  revalidatePath('/actions');
};
```
2. Redirects:
```ts
import {revalidatePath} from "next/cache";
import {redirect} from "next/navigation";

export const createUserAction = async (formData: FormData) => {
  'use server'
  const firstName = formData.get('firstName') as string;
  const lastName = formData.get('lastName') as string;
  const newUser: User = {firstName, lastName, id: Date.now().toString()};
  await saveUser(newUser);
  //revalidatePath('/actions');
  redirect('/');
};

```
- Please note we cannot put redirect inside a try-catch block
```ts
try {
  await saveUser(newUser);
  // will trigger error
  redirect('/');
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

# Pending State (UseFormStatus Hook)
- The useFormStatus hook provides status information about the last form submission
- The useFormStatus hook must be called from a component that is called from inside a <form/>
- Essentially, we have to turn our submit button in the form into its own component
- useFormStatus will only return status information for the parent
- It will not return status information for any other <form> rendered in that same component or children component

```tsx
import { useFormStatus, useFormState } from 'react-dom';

const SubmitButton = () => {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return (
    <button type='submit' className={btnStyle} disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'submitting...' : 'submit'}
    </button>
  );
};
```

# useFormState hook (Now renamed to useActionState)
- Works only with React client components
- Used to display a message to the user whether the form submission was successful or not.
- a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.
- Arguments to the useFormState include the following:
  1. fn: This is the function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form
     (initially the initial State that we pass,subsequently its previous return value) as initial argument, followed by arguments that a form action usually receives.
  2. initialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked.
  3. permalink(optional): A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies.

## Returns
- This hook returns an array with 2 values:
1. The current State
2. A new action that we can pass as an action prop to our form component or formAction prop to any button component within the form.

```tsx
import {useActionState} from "react";

const [message, formAction] = useActionState(createUser, null);
return (
        <form action={formAction} className={formStyle}>
          {message && <p>{message}</p>}
          ...
        </form>
);

//Need to modify create User action
export const createUser = async (prevState: any, formData: FormData) => {
  // current state of the form
  console.log(prevState);

  const firstName = formData.get('firstName') as string;
  const lastName = formData.get('lastName') as string;
  const newUser: User = {firstName, lastName, id: Date.now().toString()};

  try {
    await saveUser(newUser);
    revalidatePath('/actions');
    // throw Error();
    return 'user created successfully...';
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return 'failed to create user...';
  }
};
```

# How to pass value to an action from a server component
- First approach is to hold a hidden value of id and pass it within formData during a submit to the server
```tsx
export const deleteUser = async (formData:FormData) => {
  const id = formData.get('id') as string;
  const users = await fetchUsers();
  let newUsers = users.filter(u => u.id !== id);
  await writeFile('users.json', JSON.stringify(newUsers));
  revalidatePath('/actions');
  //return 'user deleted successfully...';
}

//Usage of Delete User

import {deleteUser} from "@/app/utils/actions";
function DeleteButton({id}:{id:string}  ) {
  return (
          <form action={deleteUser}>
            <input type="hidden" name="id" value={id} />
            <button type="submit" className="bg-red-500 text-white text-xs rounded p-2">
              Delete
            </button>
          </form>
  )
}
export default DeleteButton

```
- Second approach is to pass value to the server with help of **bind method**
- Problem with the first approach is that the value of Id is still part of HTML and can be accessed by hackers
- An alternative to passing arguments as hidden input fields in the form (e.g. <input type="hidden" name="userId" value={userId} />) is to use the bind option.
- With this approach, the value is not part of the rendered HTML and will not be encoded.
- bind works in both Server and Client Components. It also supports progressive enhancement.
```tsx
//Here it is not necessary for us to have just id. We can even have the entire object
export const removeUser = async (id: string, formData: FormData) => {
  const name = formData.get('name') as string;
  console.log(name);

  const users = await fetchUsers();
  const updatedUsers = users.filter((user) => user.id !== id);
  await writeFile('users.json', JSON.stringify(updatedUsers));
  revalidatePath('/actions');
};

//Usage
import { deleteUser, removeUser } from '@/utils/actions';

function DeleteButton({ id }: { id: string }) {
    //We can even pass the entire object here and not just id
  const removeUserWithId = removeUser.bind(null, id);
  return (
          <form action={removeUserWithId}>
            <input type='hidden' name='name' value='shakeAndBake' />
            <button
                    type='submit'
                    className='bg-red-500 text-white text-xs rounded p-2'
            >
              delete
            </button>
          </form>
  );
}
export default DeleteButton;
```
# Route Handlers in Next.js
- With arrival of server actions there is less need for route handlers
- Allow us to create serverless functions in our application
- We don't have to set up server from scratch
- We can quickly set up endpoints in our application where we can handle server logic and communicate from front end to the endpoint
- Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs.
1. in app create folder "api"
2. in there create folder "users" with route.ts file
- The following HTTP methods are supported: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS. If an unsupported method is called, Next.js will return a 405 Method Not Allowed response.
- In addition to supporting native Request and Response. Next.js extends them with NextRequest and NextResponse to provide convenient helpers for advanced use cases.
## GET Request
```tsx
import {fetchUsers,saveUser} from "@/app/utils/actions";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export const GET = async (req:Request) => {
    const {searchParams} = new URL(req.url);
    //console.log(req);
    //console.log(searchParams)
    console.log('Search Params = '+ searchParams.get('id'));
    const users = await fetchUsers();
    return Response.json({ users });
};
```
### NextRequest and NextResponse are just wrappers around the Request/Response objects

```tsx
import {fetchUsers,saveUser} from "@/app/utils/actions";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export const GET = async (req:NextRequest) => {
  const {searchParams} = new URL(req.url);
  //console.log(req);
  //console.log(searchParams)
  console.log('Search Params = '+ searchParams.get('id'));
  console.log('Search Params using Next Request = '+ req.nextUrl.searchParams.get('id'))


  const users = await fetchUsers();
  //Here we need to provide absolute URL, so we construct it using the URL constructor
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/',req.url));
};
```

## POST Request
```tsx
export const POST = async (req:NextRequest) => {
  const user = await req.json();
  console.log(user);
  const newUser = { ...user, id: Date.now().toString() };
  await saveUser(newUser);
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/actions',req.url));
}
```

# Middleware in Next.js
- Allows us to do something before request is completed
- Middleware in Next.js is a piece of code that allows you to perform actions before a request is completed and modify the response accordingly.
- create middleware.ts in the root
- by default will be invoked for every route in your project
- We can also have matchers to invoke middleware functions for specific routes

```tsx

export function middleware(request) {
  return Response.json({ msg: 'hello there' });
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about',
};

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url));
}

// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/tours/:path*'],
};



```
# Local Build
We can build the project using the following commands

```shell
npm run build
npm start
```
- Notice that when we build we see 2 kinds of operators in the console (o,f)
- o --> means the page is rendered as static content
- f --> means the page is server-rendered on demand
- Everything is quite fast
- Static pages are built at build time
- Server built everything at build time and cached everything
- Makes our load times faster

# Caching and Routing in Next.js
- In Next.js, the App Router provides a way to handle routing in your application. 
- Unlike traditional single-page applications where routing is managed client-side, Next.js enables both server-side and static generation of pages.
- File-Based Routing: Pages are created by adding files to the pages directory. The file name determines the route.
- Dynamic Routing: Supports dynamic routes using brackets, e.g., pages/posts/[id].js matches /posts/1, /posts/2, etc.
- API Routes: Define backend endpoints within the pages/api directory.
- SSR and SSG: Supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) to optimize performance and SEO.
- Middleware: Allows running custom code before a request is completed, useful for authentication, logging, and other middleware tasks.

```shell
pages/
  index.js       # Matches the route '/'
  about.js       # Matches the route '/about'
  posts/
    [id].js      # Matches the dynamic route '/posts/:id'

```

- By leveraging the App Router, Next.js combines the best of both server-side and client-side rendering, providing a powerful and flexible framework for building web applications.

# Caching in Next.js
- In Next.js, the App Router provides several caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce server load
- **Request Memoization**: This automatically caches the return values of functions, so if the same function is called multiple times with the same arguments, it only executes once
- Data Cache: Stores data fetched from APIs or databases, allowing it to be reused across user requests and deployments
- Full Route Cache: Caches the HTML and RSC (React Server Components) payload on the server, reducing rendering costs and improving performance
- Router Cache: Caches the RSC payload on the client, reducing server requests on navigation
- By default, Next.js caches as much as possible to improve performance and reduce costs

# How to modify caching behaviour
- For API routes, you can use the Cache-Control header to control the caching behavior. Here's an example:
```js
// pages/api/data.js
//s-maxage=10 means the data will be cached by the CDN for 10 seconds.
//stale-while-revalidate=59 means the cached data can be served stale for 59 seconds while it is revalidated in the background.
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 's-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=59');
  res.status(200).json({ data: 'This is some cached data' });
}

```
- For page routes, you can use getStaticProps with revalidate to enable Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), which allows you to update static content after the page is built:
```js
// pages/index.js
//getStaticProps fetches data and returns it as props to the component.
//revalidate: 10 means the page will be regenerated at most once every 10 seconds, ensuring that the content stays up-to-date.
export default function Home({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data
    },
    revalidate: 10 // Revalidate the page every 10 seconds
  };
}

```
